## Environment Setup
Fork the repository. You will need node, npm, and bower installed.
If you do not have grunt installed, install it now.

```bash
npm install -g grunt cli bower
```

Change into the project's root directory.

```bash
npm install && bower install
```

Run Grunt with grunt. That's it!
